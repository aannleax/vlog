-- Add a simple importer from existing tables in previous EDBLayers. Now, we
   duplicate the functionality, like Trident, EDBonIDB.

-- Check whether there is a duplicate functionality on eMinus:
   both API and EDBConf?

-- EDBColumn::size() is inefficient if the EDBTable has Removals.
   Note: it looks like it is only invoked from isEmpty(). Should
   we provide a special implementation of isEmpty() if this EDBTable
   has Removals?

-- Make a DRED wrapper around Overdelete, Rederive and Add

-- Incorporate Add into Rederive -- that is doable, right?

-- Make the specification of KB EDB table flexible, think of an
   appropriate interface to specify tables for remove and add

-- Verify that Add can indeed be implemented by adding the facts in
   the add set to the Rederive step

-- Think how this DRED thingy should be fully materialized after the
   Overdelete/Rederive/Add steps have been added. In principle this is
   straightforward: write another program that derives

     I - DeltaMinus + DeltaPlus.
